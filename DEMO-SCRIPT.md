## Script

### INTRO (15-20 seconds)

**[Screen: Show demo homepage]**

> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] from RECTOR-LABS. For the Superteam Earn auto-review bounty, we didn't just submit a proposal - we built a working demo.
>
> This is the Earn Auto-Reviewer, a production-ready AI system that automatically reviews GitHub submissions for bounties. Let me show you how it works."

**Visual**: Cursor hovers over the hero title showing "Superteam Earn Auto-Reviewer"

### DEMO PART 1: Quick Example (30-40 seconds)

**[Screen: Click first example button - Next.js PR]**

> "Let's start with a real example. I'll click this Next.js pull request."

**[Screen: Show loading state]**

> "The system fetches the PR from GitHub, analyzes the code using Claude Sonnet 3.5, and generates a comprehensive review..."

**[Screen: Results appear - score and notes]**

> "In about 10 seconds, we get a complete score out of 100, broken down into four categories: code quality, completeness, testing, and innovation.
>
> Notice the actionable review notes - specific feedback that helps developers improve their submissions."

**Visual**:
- Slowly scroll to show the score breakdown
- Hover over each category
- Briefly scroll through notes

### DEMO PART 2: Custom URL (30-40 seconds)

**[Screen: Click "Review Another"]**

> "It's not limited to pre-loaded examples. Let me paste a repository URL."

**[Screen: Type/paste repository URL - React or Solana Web3.js]**

> "This works with pull requests, repositories, commits, even branch URLs."

**[Screen: Submit and show loading]**

> "The system handles edge cases gracefully - invalid URLs, private repos, 404s, empty repositories."

**[Screen: Results appear]**

> "And here's the review for a full repository. The AI analyzes the entire codebase structure, documentation, and testing setup."

**Visual**:
- Show typing URL naturally
- Show results
- Quickly scroll through notes

### TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (30-40 seconds)

**[Screen: Switch to README.md on GitHub or keep on demo site]**

> "Under the hood, this uses Next.js 14, the Vercel AI SDK with Claude Sonnet 3.5, and GitHub's REST API.
>
> We've built a complete scoring system: 40 points for code quality, 30 for completeness, 20 for testing, and 10 for innovation.
>
> The system optimizes token usage by intelligently truncating large PRs - focusing on code files rather than lockfiles or generated assets."

**Visual**:
- If showing README: scroll to architecture diagram section
- If staying on site: hover over score breakdown showing percentages

### PRODUCTION READINESS (20-30 seconds)

**[Screen: Optionally show documentation or stay on demo]**

> "This isn't just a proof of concept. We've documented the complete production integration path with BullMQ, Redis queues, and MySQL storage.
>
> The cost analysis shows approximately 2 to 5 cents per review at scale. And we've handled all the edge cases you'd encounter in production."

**Visual**:
- If showing docs: quickly scroll through INTEGRATION.md
- Otherwise: show error handling by trying an invalid URL

---

### CLOSING (15-20 seconds)

**[Screen: Back to demo homepage]**

> "This demo is live at earn-auto-review.rectorspace.com. The full source code, documentation, and integration guide are all on GitHub.
>
> We're ready to integrate this into the Superteam Earn platform and help scale bounty reviews with AI automation.
>
> Thanks for watching!"

**Visual**: Cursor hovers over footer showing GitHub link and tech stack

## Tips for Recording

### Do:
- ✅ Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- ✅ Pause for 2-3 seconds between major sections
- ✅ Keep cursor movements smooth and intentional
- ✅ Show confidence - you built something real
- ✅ Focus on value, not just features

### Don't:
- ❌ Rush through the demo
- ❌ Apologize or use filler words ("um", "uh", "so yeah")
- ❌ Make the video longer than 3 minutes
- ❌ Show errors (unless demonstrating error handling)
- ❌ Get too technical - keep it accessible

### If You Make a Mistake:
- Pause for 3 seconds
- Start the sentence/section again from the beginning
- Keep recording - edit out mistakes later
- Don't restart the entire video for small mistakes
