# Submission Checklist - Superteam Earn Bounty

**Bounty**: https://earn.superteam.fun/listing/add-github-links-to-earn-auto-reviews
**Deadline**: December 19, 2025
**Submission Type**: Path B - Standalone Demo Showcase

## Pre-Submission Requirements

### 1. OpenRouter Credits ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [ ] Go to https://openrouter.ai/credits
- [ ] Add $5-10 in credits
- [ ] Verify API key is working
- [ ] Test at least one review on live site

**Why**: Demo video needs to show live AI reviews working. Can't record without credits.

---

### 2. Test with Real Examples

**Goal**: Verify system works flawlessly with real bounty submissions

- [ ] Find 3-5 real GitHub submissions from earn.superteam.fun
- [ ] Test each URL on https://earn-auto-review.rectorspace.com
- [ ] Document results (scores, notes, edge cases)
- [ ] Take screenshots of successful reviews
- [ ] Note any issues or improvements needed

**Suggested Test Cases**:
1. A well-done PR (should score 80+)
2. A repository submission (full repo review)
3. A minimal/incomplete submission (should score <60)
4. Edge case (very large PR, empty repo, etc.)
5. Different tech stacks (Rust, Solana, TypeScript, etc.)

**Where to Find Examples**:
- Browse https://earn.superteam.fun/all-bounties
- Look for bounties with GitHub submission requirements
- Check listings with "Submission" or "Completed" status

### 3. Record Demo Video

**Goal**: 2-3 minute professional demo showing the system working

- [ ] Review DEMO-SCRIPT.md thoroughly

- [ ] Do 1-2 practice runs (don't record, just rehearse)
- [ ] Record actual video following script
- [ ] Review recording for quality
- [ ] Re-record if needed (audio issues, mistakes, etc.)

**Recording Tools** (pick one):
- Loom (easiest, auto-uploads)
- QuickTime (Mac, simple)
- OBS Studio (advanced, free)
- Screen Studio (Mac, beautiful but paid)

**Key Points to Show**:
1. Live demo URL working

4. Highlight scoring breakdown
5. Show actionable review notes
6. Mention production-ready features

```
Hello Superteam Earn team,

I'm submitting my application for the GitHub Auto-Review bounty with a working demo.

📹 Demo Video: [YOUR_VIDEO_URL]
🔗 Live Demo: https://earn-auto-review.rectorspace.com
📦 GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RECTOR-LABS/earn-auto-reviewer
📄 Full Proposal: [Link to PROPOSAL.md]

I built a production-ready AI review system using Claude Sonnet 3.5 that automatically scores GitHub submissions (0-100) and provides actionable feedback. The demo is live, fully functional, and includes comprehensive documentation for production integration.

Key highlights:
- Working demo you can test right now
- Complete scoring system (code quality, completeness, testing, innovation)
- Production integration guide with BullMQ, Redis, MySQL
- Edge case handling (404s, private repos, rate limits, etc.)
- Cost analysis: ~$0.02-0.05 per review

I've also created a detailed integration roadmap (3-4 weeks) showing exactly how this would plug into the Superteam Earn platform.

Happy to answer any questions or provide additional information.
